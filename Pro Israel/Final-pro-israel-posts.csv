את הדג הזה אמא שלי מכינה קבוע בחג שבועות .
ולמה ? כי אצלינו לא כולם אוהבים חלבי
בעיקר המבוגרים יותר
אז בשולחן החג תמיד יהיו לנו מנות דג לצד מנות חלביות חגיגיות

מצרכים:
6 פילה דג בורי ישראלי טרי חתוך לקוביות גסות ללא עור

לבלילת הקמח-
2 כוסות קמח
מלח
פלפל
כפית פפריקה גרוסה

לבלילת הביצים-
4 ביצים
חצי צרור כוסברה קצוצה 
מלח
פלפל

אופן הכנה:
נערבב את כל מרכיבי הקמח יחד ונצפה את כל הדגים היטב
נעביר לבלילת הביצים ונטגן בשמן חצי עמוק עד להזהבה יפה משני הצדדים.

למטבל-
חצי צרור כוסברה טרייה
4 שיני שום כתושות
כף גדושה אריסה
מלח
כפית כמון
רבע כוס חומץ
רבע כוס שמן
חצי כוס מים

נערבב היטב ונגיש לצד הדגים ופרוסות לימון טריות

בתאבון וחג שמח🫶🏻❤️

My mother regularly prepares this fish on Shavuot.
and why? Because with us, not everyone likes dairy
especially the older ones
So at the holiday table we will always have fish dishes alongside festive dairy dishes

Ingredients:
6 fresh Israeli mullet fish fillet cut into rough cubes without skin

for the flour batter-
2 cups of flour
Salt
pepper
A teaspoon of ground paprika

For the egg batter-
4 eggs
Half a bunch of chopped cilantro 
Salt
pepper

preparation method:
Mix all the flour ingredients together and coat all the fish well
Transfer to the egg batter and fry in semi-deep oil until nicely golden on both sides.

for dip-
Half a bunch of fresh coriander
4 crushed garlic cloves
A heaping spoonful of Arisa
Salt
A teaspoon of cumin
A quarter cup of vinegar
A quarter cup of oil
Half a glass of water

Mix well and serve alongside the fish and fresh lemon slices

Bon appetit and happy holidays 🫶🏻❤️

En arrivant à l’ @opera_comique j’avais comme mission de trouver comment vieillir les deux solistes sur scène à vue, l’idée était que plus le temps passe, plus les cheveux et poils poussent.
Il fallait trouver un moyen simple pour qu’ils puissent se mettre les perruques et postiches seuls sous le regard du public. Après beaucoup de réflexion et sous les conseils d’ @amelie_lecul , nous avons opté pour le système à aimants. Chaque élément vient s’aimanter à l’autre de manière très simple. 
Mais, pour que tout soit simple visuellement, on s’est heurté à beaucoup de questionnements : Comment placer les aimants ? Combien ? Comment faire la jonction entre chaque postiche ? ..

Il a fallut 3 semaines de travail en atelier pour fabriquer ces éléments de vieillissement. Chaque perruque et postiches ont été fabriqués sur mesure pour notre soliste @stephane.degout, les couleurs ont été minutieusement réfléchies, la coupe également, tout a été pensé pour qu’il puisse le plus simplement poser ces éléments sur lui, sans miroir. 

Un grand merci à mon équipe d’atelier, sans qui rien aurait été possible ! ✨

When I arrived at the @opera_comique my mission was to find out how to age the two soloists on stage visually, the idea was that the more time passes, the more hair grows.
We had to find a simple way so that they could put on their wigs and hairpieces alone in the public eye. After a lot of thought and under the advice of @amelie_lecul, we opted for the magnet system. Each element magnetizes to the other in a very simple way. 
But, to keep everything visually simple, we faced a lot of questions: How to place the magnets? How much ? How to connect each hairpiece? ..

It took 3 weeks of work in the workshop to manufacture these aging elements. Each wig and hairpiece were custom-made for our soloist @stephane.degout, the colors were carefully thought out, the cut as well, everything was designed so that he could easily put these elements on himself, without a mirror. 

A big thank you to my workshop team, without whom nothing would have been possible! ✨

מהרגע הראשון הכנסת אותי לעבוד איתך בביביבי ודאגת לי שם להכל ובהכל תמיד , 
כל אירוע שהיה לכם במשפחה התרגשנו וחיכינו לו רק כדי שיהיה לנו עוד זמן ביחד כמו הבת מצווה של בת דודה שלכם שהלוואי ויכלתי לשחזר אותה שוב ושוב ושוב
יכלתי תמיד לדבר איתך על הכל וידעת להגיד את המילה הכי מדויקת בזמן הכי נכון 
תמיד הייתי מסתכלת עלייך ונדהמת מכמה שאת דואגת לכולם, מחברת בין כולם, דואגת שאף אחד לא ישאר בצד וגורמת לכל אחד להרגיש שהוא מרכז העניינים והעולם באמת שאני לא יודעת איך תמיד הצלחת לעשות את זה כל כך מושלם
הילדה הכי אופטימית וממגנטת את כולם עם החיוך שלך שהוא הכי ממכר שיש
למדתי ממך כל כך הרבה והכל ילך איתי לכל החיים
כל הזמן דיברת איתי על לטוס לאיביזה בקיץ הקודם אני את ניב וינאי והינה בעזרת השם בקיץ אני וינאי נגשים את החלום הזה ואת כמובן תהי איתנו בכל רגע

Ziv I met you about five years ago through Yanai and I am grateful for every moment I had.
From the first moment you brought me to work with you at Bibibi and you took care of me there for everything and always in everything, 
Every event you had in the family we were excited and waited for it just so we could have more time together like your cousin's bat mitzvah which I wish I could recreate again and again and again
I could always talk to you about everything and you knew how to say the most accurate word at the right time 
I would always look at you and be amazed at how much you take care of everyone, connect everyone, make sure that no one is left out and make everyone feel like they are the center of things and the world really, I don't know how you always managed to do it so perfectly
The most optimistic girl and magnetizes everyone with your most addictive smile
I learned so much from you and everything will go with me for life
You kept talking to me about flying to Ibiza last summer. I speak Viennese and Hina. With God's help, this summer I'm Viennese. We will make this dream come true and of course you will be with us every moment. 
We miss you and will make sure to continue to commemorate you always. I love you ❤️‍🩹"

First, what's a chavrusa? A chavrusa is a study partner. Talmudic and other Rabbinic studies are traditionally done in pairs of two. That way true comprehension can be achieved via dialog and discussion, known as ""hondeling"".

Why the ""tumult""?

Beth Medrash Govoha is the largest Talmudic Studies Yeshiva in the US. Young men flock there to study, most often after spending a year or two in Israel, post high-school. 

In order to find the best ""chavrusa"", study partner, a kind of ""chavrusa marketplace"" takes place at the commencement of each semester. It is there and then that each individual seeks out another eligible ""match"" with whom to study with. 

Matches are made based on common subjects to study, compatibility, which sub-group to join and more.

This takes place outdoors, weather permitting, usually over the course of two or three days, and is definitely a sight to see. 

Spare me the hateful comments, nobody cares. TIA

P.'s father said: ""The difficult event that our sons went through , could have been avoided if the game had been held in a safer manner.

For the dough:
200 grams of cold flour
160 grams of butter cut into cubes and cold
109 grams of ice water
Teaspoon of salt
Preparation:
*Before you start, note that it is very important to work quickly and work when the dough is cold and the ingredients for the dough are cold, especially during the summer.
1. Cut butter into cubes and put in a bowl in the freezer for a few minutes. 2. In a mixer with a guitar hook or a kneader, put flour that came out of the refrigerator, the cubes of butter and ice water. Put as little as possible right up until the second everything comes together into one block. Immediately roll out the dough into a small rectangle, wrap it and put it in the freezer for at least twenty minutes.
3. Flour a surface and remove the dough from the plastic. Flour the dough as well and roll the dough with a rolling pin into a rectangle about 40 cm long.
4. Fold the dough into three folds like a book: fold the bottom third to the middle of the dough and top it with the top third so that you get three layers of dough.
5. Turn the dough so that the closed part is facing the right side and roll it again into a 20x15 rectangle and again make the same fold. Wrap and put in the freezer for another twenty minutes.
6. Repeat the folding operation just one more time, wrap and put in the refrigerator for ten minutes.
7. Roll the dough into a square on floured baking paper to a thickness of cm. Cut and divide the dough into four with a large knife and put the mold in the freezer for ten minutes.
8. Put a borax filling in the center of each square, I put grated Hamad cheese. Fold the edge into a triangle, and press a little.
9. Spread with egg and sprinkle with sesame seeds and put the mold in the refrigerator.
10. Heat the oven to 200 degrees. When the oven is hot, put the borax in for 2-20 minutes.
Maayan, the wife of the late Yair writes:
Yair As his name is, everywhere he shines and spreads his goodness, giving and humility. 
Yair excelled in every area of ​​his life, in his studies, at work and in the army. Everywhere you see and appreciate how special he is. Every person who met him said that Yair was able to influence him in a positive way only thanks to a small look, without words. 
Yair is the example of ""power in silence"", always leading with composure, confidence and inner peace. 
Yair left behind loving parents and brothers, and Ma'ayan his wife, theirs was an extraordinary love, one not seen in fairy tales.  Everywhere Maayan and Yair is one. She really wants to perpetuate and preserve Yair's way and goodness in the world. And so the page was opened in his memory with the help of family and friends
