Repost from @congofriends

“Basandja centers around ancestral ecology ⬇️

which is an approach that revives ancient Indigenous knowledge as a practice that advocates for a holistic understanding of, and connection with, the earth.

Here the earth is seen not merely as a repository of material resources but as a holobiont, an ensemble of closely associated species interlinked through complex symbiotic relationships that hold the entirety of life systems in balance.

The story unfolds as a profound journey into the soul of the Isangi community and Tolaw villagers to map an ancient exchange with the forest that spans millennia.”
.
.
This text is an excerpt from an article that our friends over at @terralingua.langscape published recently.

The article is an excellent exploration of what Basandja looks like in practice, as well as a fantastic behind-the-scenes into the upcoming Basandja film that documents what how indigenous wisdom is being leveraged at the grassroots level—

from the rainforests to the mines—

to bring about the changes Congolese people need.

3369211250640508542,41,-1,"There is nothing greater than Jewish Joy.  And THIS, right here...THIS is Jewish Joy. ⁠
⁠
I’m throwing it back to last weekend, celebrating my best friend’s daughter’s bat mitzvah.  My best friend who I met in 6th grade, and  became friends with as media center aids in the 8th grade. (We were in charge of the reference section...swipe all the way ➡️ for proof.) ⁠
⁠
We became friends at the same age our daughters are now. ⁠
⁠
But last weekend, despite all the darkness in the world around us, the light came on and we celebrated BIG TIME. Together with many of our friends from growing up and college, we put all of the Jewish Joy on the table. ⁠
⁠
One of the most special parts about this weekend is that this friend of mine is the one who taught me to appreciate what it means to be Jewish. 

This is a friend who listened to David Broza or Debbie Friedman, while most of us got into our cars in high school and popped in a mixed tape filled with @Phish (or that other band we no longer listen to.)
⁠
This is a friend who has more friends who are rabbis than most people have friends (which inherently means I do too...), and that makes us both incredibly #blessed. ⁠
⁠
She instilled in me the value of going to temple, knowing the meaning of the prayers and the importance of surrounding myself with Jewish community.  Ultimately, she was the one who convinced me to go on the trip that changed my life forever, @motlorg.⁠
⁠
And so celebrating the bat mitzvah my daughter in October and her daughter this past weekend, TOGETHER, has meaning beyond no other. And rght now, there is simply nothing better than a Jewish milestone celebration.  So find yourself a friend who’s having a bar or bat mitzvah...or one who’s getting married. ⁠
⁠
You will walk away with your heart filled in a way that I promise will carry you far into the next week and beyond. ⁠
⁠
And do you want to know the best part?  I get to do it all over again in a week...and then again three weeks later.  All with my oldest, dearest and closest of friends from growing up.
⁠
We are so damn lucky. #AmYisraelChai⁠

Being your daughter is one of life’s greatest gifts to me and I’m forever grateful for the time we had shared together. While 13 years with you wasn’t nearly enough, I don’t think any amount of time would’ve been enough with you. 35 years on this Earth was not enough for someone like you. I’m almost certain that there’s no one else like you, you were unlike anyone I’ve ever gotten to know. 35 years and you made such a positive impact on people. I wish you had known the impact you made on everyone and how much everyone misses you. I still get messages from people here and there about you and memories they had with you. Man you were everyone’s friend 🤣 and I love that about you. She was a boss and knew it 💋. We may have not had forever but I appreciate what you were able to teach me in such a short amount of time. To always be humble never entitled. Show gratitude instead of attitude. Kill them with kindness. To find the light in your darkest hours. Find opportunities if they aren’t presented to you. Be extra because who cares (and I’m certainly your daughter on that note). Always carry lipgloss in your purse. Check in on the people you love. Make every day count because we’re not promised tomorrow. All that plus more. We made a hell of a team together and will continue to do so! I’m so grateful we were in the same lifetime together and will always cherish our memories. You’ve always been my idol and my inspiration to be who I am today. Days like today are harder without you here but I know you’d want us to keep living on for you. You are missed and loved by many. We’re keeping your memory alive! I love you to the moon and back mom 🌙 I’ll be seeing you in my dreams. Rest easy for me 🐘🤍
