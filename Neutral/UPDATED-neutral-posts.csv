Repost from @congofriends

“Basandja centers around ancestral ecology ⬇️

which is an approach that revives ancient Indigenous knowledge as a practice that advocates for a holistic understanding of, and connection with, the earth.

Here the earth is seen not merely as a repository of material resources but as a holobiont, an ensemble of closely associated species interlinked through complex symbiotic relationships that hold the entirety of life systems in balance.

The story unfolds as a profound journey into the soul of the Isangi community and Tolaw villagers to map an ancient exchange with the forest that spans millennia.”
.
.
This text is an excerpt from an article that our friends over at @terralingua.langscape published recently.

The article is an excellent exploration of what Basandja looks like in practice, as well as a fantastic behind-the-scenes into the upcoming Basandja film that documents what how indigenous wisdom is being leveraged at the grassroots level—

from the rainforests to the mines—

to bring about the changes Congolese people need.

3369211250640508542,41,-1,"There is nothing greater than Jewish Joy.  And THIS, right here...THIS is Jewish Joy. ⁠
⁠
I’m throwing it back to last weekend, celebrating my best friend’s daughter’s bat mitzvah.  My best friend who I met in 6th grade, and  became friends with as media center aids in the 8th grade. (We were in charge of the reference section...swipe all the way ➡️ for proof.) ⁠
⁠
We became friends at the same age our daughters are now. ⁠
⁠
But last weekend, despite all the darkness in the world around us, the light came on and we celebrated BIG TIME. Together with many of our friends from growing up and college, we put all of the Jewish Joy on the table. ⁠
⁠
One of the most special parts about this weekend is that this friend of mine is the one who taught me to appreciate what it means to be Jewish. 

This is a friend who listened to David Broza or Debbie Friedman, while most of us got into our cars in high school and popped in a mixed tape filled with @Phish (or that other band we no longer listen to.)
⁠
This is a friend who has more friends who are rabbis than most people have friends (which inherently means I do too...), and that makes us both incredibly #blessed. ⁠
⁠
She instilled in me the value of going to temple, knowing the meaning of the prayers and the importance of surrounding myself with Jewish community.  Ultimately, she was the one who convinced me to go on the trip that changed my life forever, @motlorg.⁠
⁠
And so celebrating the bat mitzvah my daughter in October and her daughter this past weekend, TOGETHER, has meaning beyond no other. And rght now, there is simply nothing better than a Jewish milestone celebration.  So find yourself a friend who’s having a bar or bat mitzvah...or one who’s getting married. ⁠
⁠
You will walk away with your heart filled in a way that I promise will carry you far into the next week and beyond. ⁠
⁠
And do you want to know the best part?  I get to do it all over again in a week...and then again three weeks later.  All with my oldest, dearest and closest of friends from growing up.
⁠
We are so damn lucky. #AmYisraelChai⁠

Being your daughter is one of life’s greatest gifts to me and I’m forever grateful for the time we had shared together. While 13 years with you wasn’t nearly enough, I don’t think any amount of time would’ve been enough with you. 35 years on this Earth was not enough for someone like you. I’m almost certain that there’s no one else like you, you were unlike anyone I’ve ever gotten to know. 35 years and you made such a positive impact on people. I wish you had known the impact you made on everyone and how much everyone misses you. I still get messages from people here and there about you and memories they had with you. Man you were everyone’s friend 🤣 and I love that about you. She was a boss and knew it 💋. We may have not had forever but I appreciate what you were able to teach me in such a short amount of time. To always be humble never entitled. Show gratitude instead of attitude. Kill them with kindness. To find the light in your darkest hours. Find opportunities if they aren’t presented to you. Be extra because who cares (and I’m certainly your daughter on that note). Always carry lipgloss in your purse. Check in on the people you love. Make every day count because we’re not promised tomorrow. All that plus more. We made a hell of a team together and will continue to do so! I’m so grateful we were in the same lifetime together and will always cherish our memories. You’ve always been my idol and my inspiration to be who I am today. Days like today are harder without you here but I know you’d want us to keep living on for you. You are missed and loved by many. We’re keeping your memory alive! I love you to the moon and back mom 🌙 I’ll be seeing you in my dreams. Rest easy for me 🐘🤍

Fresh off the plane from Taiwan, @comebuytea_seattle is the newest boba shop in town. Their Teapresso Machines brew a fresh cup of tea for every order, meaning you’re not drinking tea that’s been sitting for hours! Watching the steam and noise of each drink being made was like being in Willy Wonka’s factory. 

This is only the second ComeBuyTea location in the USA, so 📍Capitol Hill should feel pretty special! I strongly recommend ordering a tea based drink, like their Hong Kong Milk Tea or the Sun Moon Lake Black Tea. I’m not sure what they put in their waffle batter, but you absolutely cannot miss it. The mango waffle was the highlight for me, and I’m intrigued by the corn & ham waffle. Add ComeBuyTea to your list of favorite boba shops to hit before a night out in Capitol Hill 😉💌",
3373794666724908458,6199,14584,"4 months of progress - comment or DM “schedule” for my workout schedule 🤍

consistent sloppy action will always beat “once in a while” perfection

I used to think that unless the workout was 30+ minutes, it “doesn’t count” - so as I entered the world of motherhood, it became harder and harder to feel like I was accomplishing something as my time for me became less and less. 

Now being a mom of 2 I can proudly say that I have recognized that consistent short, or even easy workout sessions have CARRIED me to my goals. 

Of course every once in a while I have more time available to me, but as a general rule I now know that even if the workout is 10 minutes or “just a stretch”, it’s contributing to my consistency streak.

If you’re a few weeks or even a few months into your journey and you feel like you’ve been consistent but haven’t seen any changes, don’t stop because it’s “not working”, keep going and adjust to your personal needs. 

You WILL reach your goals. 

Here’s what you can do step by step:
1. Make a mental note of your set workout time (Monday- Friday), and create a backup time for the days something comes up to change your schedule 
2. Comment or DM “schedule” so you have my exact momday to Friday schedule to follow so you’re never guessing what workout to do
3. Set a goal of at least 2 weeks of consistency, even if it means swapping out the scheduled workout for a short stretch. Make that streak happen 👏🏽
4. Join our accountability calls on growwithjo home to ignite your motivation, ask questions, learn more about how to customize your nutrition, and feel less alone. 

I know life is crazy and you’ve tried this many times before. 

This is your opportunity to do things differently and finally get consistent.

3322298982552867488,33308,4521206,"3 min en scène VS 3 semaines de travail 🥵

En arrivant à l’ @opera_comique j’avais comme mission de trouver comment vieillir les deux solistes sur scène à vue, l’idée était que plus le temps passe, plus les cheveux et poils poussent.
Il fallait trouver un moyen simple pour qu’ils puissent se mettre les perruques et postiches seuls sous le regard du public. Après beaucoup de réflexion et sous les conseils d’ @amelie_lecul , nous avons opté pour le système à aimants. Chaque élément vient s’aimanter à l’autre de manière très simple. 
Mais, pour que tout soit simple visuellement, on s’est heurté à beaucoup de questionnements : Comment placer les aimants ? Combien ? Comment faire la jonction entre chaque postiche ? ..

Il a fallut 3 semaines de travail en atelier pour fabriquer ces éléments de vieillissement. Chaque perruque et postiches ont été fabriqués sur mesure pour notre soliste @stephane.degout, les couleurs ont été minutieusement réfléchies, la coupe également, tout a été pensé pour qu’il puisse le plus simplement poser ces éléments sur lui, sans miroir. 

Un grand merci à mon équipe d’atelier, sans qui rien aurait été possible ! ✨

3369523411654250468,12,60,"My heart has been melting for maternity sessions lately, and these two REALLY REASSURED ME OF IT. LIKE CMON. THEY ARE SO CUTE. 😭🥲😍

Ellie and Anthony have one of the most incredible stories. They first met at the church they both attended, but they did not bond until later. During 2018, their young adults group went on a mission trip to the Dominican Republic to work with children who had HIV/AIDS. And guess who both went 😉

When they first arrived, it was the same as usual, they didn’t really talk. Fast forward to the last few days of the trip, they finally connected. And man, that connection was STRONG, because the rest was history… They stayed up as a group late into the night where Ellie and Anthony got to talk in depth for the first time 🥰

Their very first date was in Princeton. Sushi date plus walking around equals a perfect night, right?! Like that’s definitely my vision of a perfect night! 🍣😍 Even though Ellie grew up in Princeton, that was Anthony’s first time ever going. Ellie showed him the best ice cream, Halo Pub, and then showed him around the beautiful university. Fast forward 5 years, they got married in Princeton 🥹

Along with Princeton being their favorite spot ever, their favorite drink to get together is some good ole kung fu tea. I mean now I’m craving milk tea ;,) Some fun facts about them is that Anthony likes laying on the floor, while Ellie likes to eat bananas while they’re still green. They’re iconic, these two. ☺️ Along with their special quirks together, they have a secret handshake. I don’t think it’s possible for them to be cuter…

These two wanted to capture the joy of welcoming their daughter into this world. They got married in August 2023, and are now ecstatic to bring their precious daughter into the world, any day now. It was an absolute joy sharing these moments with them. May God bless them on their new journey together with their daughter. I truly feel like God’s love shines off these two, and I am so honored to share these precious photos. 🥹",
